    <p>This is the doofus who loves chasing squirrels. Although she's come close many times, she's never caught one.</p>
    <p>Let's help her get her <em>first</em> squirrel!</p>
    <h3>Just use the arrow keys to tell Sydney where to go. Look out for squirrels in the yard and try to get Sydney to catch them!</h3>
